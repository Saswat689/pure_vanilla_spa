## A Single Page Application built using The History Api and ES6 classes

This application was made to fulfill the needs of a current application which we were buiilding in plain view engine. The purpose was not to include a framework.The application is built using the ES6 classes and History Api.

## Getting started :rocket:

If you want to use it fork the repo and create different classes that have a method of getHtml and pass in your html. In the index.js(main file) add a path object to navigate to in the routes array.

Changing the world, Saswat.
